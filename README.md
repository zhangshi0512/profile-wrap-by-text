### Technical Projection for GenAI Web Application

#### **Feature 1: Image Upload**

- **Key Functions:**

  - File input form.
  - Server-side API to receive image data.
  - Image validation and storage.

- **Technologies:**

  - **Frontend:** Next.js for UI, TypeScript for type safety.
  - **Backend:** API routes in Next.js.
  - **Storage:** Supabase Storage or AWS S3 for storing images.

- **Implementation Plan:**

  - Create a form with an image input in Next.js.
  - Set up an API route to handle uploads using `multer` for multipart form data.
  - Validate image file types and sizes.
  - Upload the image to Supabase Storage or AWS S3.
  - Return a link to the uploaded image.

- **Time Estimate:**
  - Form and Client-side validation: 2 hours.
  - Server-side API and validation: 3 hours.
  - Supabase/AWS S3 integration: 2 hours.

#### **Feature 2: Background Removal**

- **Key Functions:**

  - Real-time image processing to detect and remove backgrounds.
  - Human figure detection.

- **Technologies:**

  - **Processing API:** remove.bg API for background removal based on bg API documentation.
  - **Framework:** Next.js serverless functions for API interaction.

- **Implementation Plan:**

  - Integrate remove.bg API using an API route in Next.js.
  - Send the uploaded image to remove.bg via their API.
  - Retrieve the processed image with the background removed.

- **Time Estimate:**
  - remove.bg API integration: 2 hours.
  - Error handling and testing: 2 hours.

#### **Feature 3: Text Wrapping**

- **Key Functions:**

  - Detect the boundary of the human figure.
  - Implement text flow around the boundary.

- **Technologies:**

  - **Frontend:** Next.js with CSS Grid or Flexbox for text layout.
  - **Backend:** Image processing to detect the boundary (potentially using a canvas element or a library like p5.js).

- **Implementation Plan:**

  - Use canvas or p5.js to detect the shape of the human figure.
  - Design a text wrapping component in Next.js that uses the figure's boundary as a text flow guide.
  - Allow users to input custom text to wrap around the image.

- **Time Estimate:**
  - Boundary detection and canvas implementation: 4 hours.
  - Text wrapping component: 3 hours.
  - User input and custom text functionality: 2 hours.

#### **Overall Time Estimate:**

- Total Estimated Time: 20 hours
